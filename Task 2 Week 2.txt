Git is a version control system that allows users to monitor changes in their code. GitHub is a web-based hosting service for git repositories.
Both are great tools and contain a vast array of features like editing and server to server viewing.
Git hub provides us a platform to store code on,it is a cloud based system so we dont have to worry about losing our code as it is always stored in the main server cloud.

Many misconception occur in peoples minds as what is github?Many of my friends thought that it was a proggraming language site. However, GitHub doesnâ€™t teach any programming, and its usage comes when one has a program or code to push and save on a cloud repository.

Some of the main key differences is listed below 
Git:-

Version Control System: Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project concurrently.

Local: Git operates locally on your computer. It doesn't require an internet connection to track changes or commit code.

Command Line: Git primarily operates through a command-line interface, although there are graphical user interfaces available.

No Hosting: Git itself is not a hosting service; it's just a tool for managing version control. You can use Git on your local machine or set up your own Git server.

Free and Open Source: Git is free and open-source software. It was created by Linus Torvalds, the same person who created Linux.

GitHub:-

Git Repository Hosting: GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. It allows users to store their Git repositories in the cloud, making it easier to collaborate and share code with others.

Collaboration: GitHub offers features for collaboration, such as pull requests, issues, and code reviews, which facilitate teamwork on software projects.

Web-Based Interface: GitHub provides a user-friendly web interface for managing repositories, making it accessible to developers who may not be familiar with the command line.

Social and Networking Features: GitHub includes social features such as following users, starring repositories, and discussions on code. It's a platform for building a developer community.
